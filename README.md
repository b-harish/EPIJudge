# EPI Judge

Forked Repo to practice problems described in [Elements of Programming Interviews](https://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com/) Book.

README.md is updated so that it won't be same as the original repo. **Removed problem folders in C++ and Java since I practice only in Python**. Using this repo for my own practice of problems.

Here's the repo from which I forked this project. [EPIJudge](https://github.com/adnanaziz/EPIJudge).

## Introduction

EPI Judge is meant to serve as a companion to our book Elements of Programming Interviews. Specifically, this project consists of the following:

- **Stub programs** for each problem in our book in Python, Java, and C++
- **Test-cases** that cover common corner-case and performance bugs
- A **framework** for running these tests on your implementation on your machine

## Running the judge from the command line

### Python

    $ python3 <program_name>.py

The file [index.html](https://github.com/adnanaziz/EPIJudge/blob/master/index.html) in the root of this project tracks your progress through the problems. Specifically, there's an expanding tab for each chapter. Click on it, and you will see your progress, e.g., as below. This file gets updated each time you execute a program. You can **use this file to map book problems to stub programs**.

## Acknowledgments

A big shout-out to the hundreds of users who tried out the release over the past couple of months. As always, we never fail to be impressed by the enthusiasm and commitment our readers have; it has served to bring out the best in us.
We all thank [Viacheslav Kroilov](https://github.com/metopa), for applying his exceptional software engineering skills to make EPI Judge a reality.
